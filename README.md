# Event Go Round

Event Go Around is a simple event system in golang planned for use to dispatch events for game backends. It was designed and written when i started working on a gaming backend as my first serious golang project. Initially this event system was written as a part of the backend, but then making it its own package seemed like a good idea since it can be used for all sorts of things requiring event based synchronization.
